# Gulp Starter Workflow

This is a basic, and ever evolving workflow for using Gulp with various web projects. I wanted something could add to most projects, weather it was a WordPress theme, Jeykll site build or static HTML site build. 

Currently this is configured around HTML static builds.

The primary goals of this experiment:

1. Compile sass, add prefixes, and spit out a minified file.
2. Concat JS and spit out minified file.
3. Compile HTML partials, compress and spit out file.
4. Build (Deployment structure of site)
5. Serve HTML and refresh the browser with changes using browserSync
6. Deploy changes to Github or Amazon AWS

TO-DO List

This still needs work, right now Iâ€™m working on an HTML templating project. Still working out a few bugs, and need to make this so I can copy paste to various projects and get going.

Also, need to improve this README


#### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### Run tasks:
```
gulp
